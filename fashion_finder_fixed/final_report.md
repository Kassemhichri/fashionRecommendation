### 2. Enhanced AI Recommendation System
The new recommendation system uses a hybrid approach combining:
- **Visual Embeddings**: Vector representations of product images
- **Metadata Analysis**: Encoding of product attributes
- **User Preference Modeling**: Comprehensive user preference vectors
- **Fashion Knowledge**: Expert rules about complementary items and color compatibility

The system provides personalized recommendations with clear explanations of why each item was selected.

### 3. Chatbot Integration
A simple rule-based chatbot has been added that can:
- Answer questions about fashion styles
- Provide outfit recommendations for different occasions

The style quiz has been simplified and improved:
- Focused on key style dimensions (style, color, occasion, fit)
- Added clear descriptions and visual options
- Created direct mapping between answers and product attributes
- Enhanced recommendation accuracy through better preference mapping

### 5. Documentation Updates
Comprehensive documentation has been provided:
- Detailed README with feature explanations
- Technical details of the AI recommendation system
- Explanation of the chatbot functionality
- Description of the improved quiz system
